# PersonalFinanceTracker
This program is a personal finance tracker that helps users manage transactions. 

Users can add transactions with a description, amount, and date formated as (MM-YYYY). 

Users can also view all transactions, calculate totals for a specific month-year, and see the total for all transactions. 

It features input validation and a simple menu interface for ease of use.

Below is an image of the programming running and how it works:
